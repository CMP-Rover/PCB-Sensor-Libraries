Tasks :
-Each member is required to implement sensor integrated library package (Schematic, footprint, and 3D model) knowing its dimensions from internet
-Also, you need to know each sensor's electrical specifications and how it can be connected with Arduino


Sensors: 
*****Be aware that each sensor may have different module packages so stay with the one in each link*************
